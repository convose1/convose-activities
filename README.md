# Convose activity guide

Our mission is to add 1000s of multiplayer activities and games to Convose, searchable through a popup in the chat:

Eventually every possible activity/game you can imagine will be there. 

Our goal is to attract many developers to help us reach this goal. Developers will receive 80% of any profits generated by the activities. They can choose when Youtube ads show over the activities:

To build an activity for Convose just make a website of that activity, send us the URL and we will show the activity in Convose using Iframe. It should be responsive mobile view if possible will take up full mobile screen where desktop view will be within the fullscreen call view like this:

Right now we're just beginning these activities, so there's no formal process yet, we're looking developers we could talk/work closely with to help us know what is important to developers for this. Talk with us by joining our slack here: https://join.slack.com/t/convosecommunity/shared_invite/zt-2drs8s092-o5_JnX3tpjl8Q4zOw0cmSQ

Incase you can't host the website of your activity yourself we can also host it on our server.

Hope to work with you!
