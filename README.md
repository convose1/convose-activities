Our mission is to add 1000s of multiplayer activities and games to Convose, searchable through a popup in the chat:

Eventually every possible activity/game you can imagine will be there. 

Our goal is to attract many developers to help us reach this goal. Developers will receive 80% of any profits generated by the activities. They can choose when Youtube ads show over the activities:

To build an activity for Convose just make a website of that activity, we will show the activity in Convose using Iframe. It should be responsive mobile view will take up full mobile screen where desktop view will be within the fullscreen call view:

Talk directly with us, the Convose team, with all the specific questions, we are very eager to work with you! We can even discuss activity ideas and design together if you can't think of one to do yourself. Best to start with some simple activities first to see the whole process. I'm sure there's lots of opensource JS games out there we can use for this?

Incase you can't host the website activity yourself we can also host it on our server. Just let us know and we'll do this.
