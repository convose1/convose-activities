# Convose activity guide

Our mission is to add many multiplayer activities and games to Convose, searchable through a popup in the chat:

Eventually, every possible activity/game you can imagine will be there. 

Our goal is to attract many developers to help us reach this goal. Developers will receive 80% of any profits generated by the activities. They can choose when Youtube ads show over the activities:

Also in-activity purchases or paid activities.

To build an activity for Convose just make a website of that activity, send us the URL and we will show the activity in Convose using Iframe. Ideally it should be responsive 
for both mobile & desktop. For mobile and desktop an activity would look like this:

Right now we're just beginning these activities, so there's no formal process yet, we're looking for developers who could talk/work closely with our team. Talk with us by joining our slack here: https://join.slack.com/t/convosecommunity/shared_invite/zt-2drs8s092-o5_JnX3tpjl8Q4zOw0cmSQ

Incase you can't host the website of your activity yourself we can also host it on our server.

Hope to work with you!
